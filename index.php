                The President of the Senate, Ahmed Lawal has assured Public Complaints Commission (PCC) of the readiness
                of the 9th Assembly to strengthen it for effective discharge of its mandate.
                Lawal said this while receiving the Honourable Chief Commissioner and other Commissioners who paid him a
                courtesy visit on Monday in his office at the National Assembly.
                The Senate President who acknowledged the Commission as one of the institutions supervised by the
                National Assembly regretted the financial challenges presently faced by the Commission and pledged that
                the National Assembly will improve the financial situation considering its importance.
                He urged the Commission to strengthen its synergy with the other Government agencies and the media, most
                especially the Government media in order to obtain minimal charges for publicity.
                Lawal also drew the attention of the management of the Commission to the need to train and retrain the
                staff to ensure efficiency in the discharge of their duties.
                Earlier in his address, the Hon. Chief Commissioner of PCC, Hon. Chille Igbawua said that his visit was
                to congratulate the Senate President and members of his team and pledge the Commission’s readiness to
                work closely with them to ensure social justice and good governance for all Nigerians.
                The Hon. Chief Commissioner further said the Commission is committed to ensuring best administrative
                practices in the country but is being hindered by certain challenges.
                He listed the challenges to include inadequate funding, inadequate office accommodation especially in
                the states and shortage of operational vehicles among others.
                On the need for more visibility for the Commission, Hon. Igbawua emphasised that the Commission is doing
                all its best to publicize its activities within its limited resources and said the Commission is
                currently engaging with media houses, social media platforms as well as publications to enlighten
                members of the public on its activities and mandate.
                The Nigerian Ombudsman disclosed that since his assumption of Office a year ago, he has been working
                hard to strengthen the relationship between the Commission with National and International Agencies as
                well as civil Society organizations in order to widen the horizon of the Commission.
                He used the opportunity to inform the Senate President of the forthcoming Ombudsman Expo which will be
                hosted by the Commission before the end of this year, 2019.

                The Speaker House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila has assured the Public Complaints
                Commission of the preparedness of the House of Representatives to support the Commission to effectively
                carry out its mandate of redressing all forms of administrative injustices in the country.
                The Speaker disclosed this on Tuesday while playing host to the Chief Commissioner, Commissioners and
                Management Staff of the Commission who came on a courtesy visit to him in his office at the National
                Assembly Complex Abuja.
                Hon. Gbajabiamila acknowledged and praised the efforts of the Chief Commissioner, Hon. Chille Igbawua in
                trying to reposition the Public Complaints commission within just a year in office and employed the
                Commissioners to put in more effort as the Commission remains the last hope of the average Nigerians who
                cannot afford the high cost of litigation in the regular court.
                He emphasized that the House of Representatives will look into the Act establishing the Commission to
                find ways of making the Commission revenue generating so as to address the problem of paucity of fund
                that hampers the Commission’s operations adding that the House will also try to straighten areas where
                the functions of the Commission conflicts with the Committee of the House of Representatives in charge
                of Public Petitions so that both organs of the National Assembly won’t be carrying out same functions.

            <div class="modal-body"> The newly appointed Chief Commissioner of the Public Complaints Commission, Chille
                Igbawua said the agency will win back the trust of the people by ensuring that all complaints brought
                before it are treated with fairness.
                Speaking yesterday in Abuja during his maiden press briefing, Igbawua said his regime would correct past
                shortcomings of the commission.
                On the issue of ignorance to summons, Igbawua lamented that if other leaders of the commission were
                lenient, his leadership will not be lenient with people who do not respond to summons by the commission.
                He stated that the act establishing the commission gave it powers to summon anyone reported and to
                prosecute anyone, who fails to respond to summons, hence he would invoke the powers of the commission to
                deliver justice.
